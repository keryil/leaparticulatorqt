Hello!

And welcome to the experiment.

Please read all of the text throughout the experiment. 

Throughout, you will see images which you need to create signals for. Make sure you can remember your signal for each image as you will be asked to recognise your signals during the experiment as well!

In the experiment there are 3 phases, each phase has 2 sessions, and each session has a signal creation task and a signal recognition task. 

You will create signals throughout using the Leap Motion detector in front of you. This is an infrared sensor which can sense where your hand above of it. You should move your hand either left or right to manipulate the signal. You can try this now.

Signals can not be more than 1 second long. When you press record, a timer at the top of the screen will show the second passing. You can play the signal back, you can rerecord the signal if you would like to. 

Please press Okay when you are ready to start the experiment.
