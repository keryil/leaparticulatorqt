This is now the second round for the same images you had in the first round. 

To generate a signal is the same:

1. press Record
2. create your signal
3. press Stop

Signals can not be more than 1 second long. When you press record, a timer at the top of the screen will show the second passing.

If you pause within your signal, the silent period will be deleted in the recorded signal. 

You may play your signal back by pressing Play. You may rerecord your signal if you are not happy. 

When you have finished press Submit.
